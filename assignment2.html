      Layout of Ardibo Lodge<br></br>
      Accommodation consists of five independent twin room bungalows (chalets) with two bed rooms and lounge in the middle. each chalet consists of 2 double rooms equipped with one double bed, one bunk bed along with its own sanitary facilities. the rooms are separated by the spacious   and attractive lounge with fireplace and dining place. 
      the chalet rooms can be occupied either by individual travelers  (single or travelers in pairs maximum 4 persons per room) by sharing the lounge or without using or sharing the lounge, or by families and groups who rent the entire chalet together with the lounge. 
      each room has separate access to the lounge. the entire layout of  the chalet rooms with veranda in addition to the grouping of the chalets, guarantees maximum privacy 
      <br></br>
      Guests are given the choice of having the meals in the chalets (dinning place or chalet veranda) or at the restaurant, which also explains the surplus of waiters mentioned in the budget proposal 
      The maximum capacity of the 5 twin room chalets will be 40 guests 
      The attractiveness of the extra spacious lounge, fire place and eating area offers guest’s greater value and comfort. the family appreciates the higher “sleeping” capacity of an entire chalet and its inherent economy, including a free breakfast. 
      all this is an equally valuable asset to the business travelers and leisure travelers. the dual  attraction  of  the  twin  room  chalets  with  lounge  to  both  leisure  and  business travelers is what keeps the occupancy high on both weekends and weekdays; it is the most appropriate product type of all to build in today's lodging market, especially where medium-priced demand is strong.
